# MCAutoEffect
A wrapper for Minecraft 1.16.3's Effect type that makes special cosmetic functionality easy.

# What does it offer?
Glad you asked. Here's the to-do list:

✅ A method to return a ResourceLocation to a single 18x18 image that will be used as the effect's icon.<br/>
⬛ A method to return a ResourceLocation to a texture atlas to get the effect's icon at a given coordinate.<br/>
✅ A method of returning a custom duration string.<br/>
✅ A built-in method of returning absurdly long duration strings that support the display of hours, capping at 96 hours before it resorts to \*\*:\*\*:\*\*.<br/>
✅ A built-in method of returning absurdly high effect amplifiers as Roman numerals, capping at 1000 for the most daring of modders.<br/>
⬛ A method of displaying custom HUD icons (e.g. how poison makes your hearts green or wither makes them black)<br/>
✅ A method of easily picking to omit certain display data, such as only rendering the effect's name or time in the center of the rectangle in the inventory space.<br/>
✅ A method of selecting a maximum display amplifier.<br/>
✅ A method of defining a name text color.<br/>
✅ A method of defining a timer text color.<br/>
✅ A method of easily overwriting the timer text to something else, such as a subtitle.<br/>
✅ A method of constructing a new EffectInstance with fewer arguments.<br/>
✅ A method of easily constructing an EffectInstance with infinite duration.<br/>
